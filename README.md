# Nuxt + Stripe

Welcome to my Nuxt + Stripe tutorial. This repo follows alongside my [Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/@codybontecou) covering how to integrate Stripe into a Nuxt application. 

This course covers Authentication with @sidebase/nuxt-auth and Github, Stripe Checkout, Stripe Billing Portal, Stripe Webhooks, Stripe Subscriptions, and more.

Each branch of this repo represents a different section of the course. For example, branch 01-installation should be 1:1 with the first video of the course.
